# Karabiner Configuration

1. I'm using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage Karabiner configuration file
   symlinking, which should explain why the `karabiner.json` file is in a subdirectory.
2. I'm also using [goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo) to auto-generate the
   [karabiner.json](./.config/karabiner/karabiner.json) file. So, if you want to referency my
   configuration, you should look at the `goku` configuration file
   [here](./.config/karabiner/karabiner.edn).
